Taskforce API Library for PHP
=============================

Use Taskforce to convert emails into tasks, so you can save time and stay organized. Taskforce integrates into your Gmail inbox using a browser extension so you can manage all your tasks from within your emails.

Taskforce, as well as providing extensions for browsers, allows developers to integrate the service into their applications with the [Taskforce API](http://www.taskforceapp.com/api). 

This library is a work in progress, and will allow you to quickly access methods of the Taskforce API from within your scripts written in [PHP](http://php.net). 

### API Methods

Once the library is somewhere approaching done and I get round to it, I will list all the API methods in the library and how they work. Until then, you can just take a look at the script in Taskforce.inc.php, and use the [API guide](http://www.taskforceapp.com/api) on the Taskforce website.
